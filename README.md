# Algorithm Practice

## Explanation
This is a repository with my practice exercises as I code along with the Front End Masters course "A Practical Guide to Algorithms with JavaScript". We did not delve into Algorithms in any great detail in the General Assembly bootcamp that I completed, and I am interested in beginning to learn more about this topic.
